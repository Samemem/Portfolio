      <h2>Website Development</h2>
      <p>I wanted to showcase my projects and this portfolio gives me the opportunity to chose how
          to do it. I learnt HTML and CSS basics to create the website from scratch. However,
          I realised that making it responsive was time consuming, and I wanted to push the visuals a step further.
          This led me to use Chat GPT for specific needs, which I found really useful.
      </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden2">
      <h2>Bird Detection App</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/cygnes.jpg" >
      <p>
        In a group project at IMT Atlantique, we gathered detection and classification algorithms
        with a user-frindely interface to help ornithologists count birds in Lorient harbor. The 
        image recognition system used Tensor-flow and the interface was coded in Java.
        At the end of the work, we delivered to the client a complete and powerful tool that participates 
        in the avifauna wellbeing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden3">
      <h2>Pacman AI</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/pacman.png" >
      <p>During my studies in Madrid, I worked on a project by groups of 2 to develop an Artificial
        Intelligence for Pacman in Python. In a slight modified version of the game, we applied 
        techniques of classification and reinforcement learning to obtain the  best score. We 
        even reached the top 3 of the best autonomous agents in the challenge !
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden4">
      <h2>Antenna Control System</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/antenne.png" >
      <p> With 2 other IMT Atlantique students, we prototyped a system to control an antenna, so that
        it would automatically point towards the direction of a probe balloon. We used electronics, 
        mechanics and control theories.
        This would later be used to ensure an efficient communication with a nanosatellite.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden5">
      <h2>Autonomous Arduino Car</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/fpa_voiture1.jpg" >
      <p>
        From assembling the robot to calibrating the obstacle detection, we went through all the steps of 
        the development of the miniature self driving car. We could either control it remotely, or let it
        traverse an obstacle course. The Arduino software was coded in C++.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden6">
      <h2>PyRat Challenge</h2>
      <img src="resources/images/pyrat.jpg" >
     <p>This project consisted in developing an artificial intelligence to maximize the score
      of a game developed specifically for this project. In this game, a rat goes through a maze 
      and tries to eat as much cheese as possible within a defined duration. The agent was
      coded in Python thanks to graph theory and consisted in finding rapidly decent solutions of 
      the travelling salesman problem before the game starts.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden7">
      <h2>Offshore windfarms and vessel traffic</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/ais_heatmap.jpg">
      <p>We worked for a public company to estimate the influence of offshore wind farms on
        vessel traffic, especially pleasure crafts. The study was possible thanks to Automatic 
        Identification System data gathered since 2016 which was analyzed in parallel with 
        wind farms construction zones.<br/>
        To meet the clients need, we applied geospatial analysis techniques to a huge volume of data
        with Python, and visualized it with the GIS open source tool QGIS.
        After a thorough data anlysis to unbias the data, we observed that the trafic decreased of 60% 
        in the windfarm areas, and 10% 10 km away from the farms.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden8">
      <h2>Atmospheric pollution and birds</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/birds_predict1.jpg">
      <p>We analyzed data of birds observations and air quality to establish the impact of atmospheric pollution on the avifauna.
        The bird observations had to be converted into abundance, which reflects more the actual distribution of birds. <br/>
        Then we trained several time series algorithms like ARIMA, Linear regression, Random Forest and XGBoost with air quality indicators as 
        input varibales to predicts birds abundance across several counties in the US. We thus managed to show that some species might come instinct if measures weren't taken against 
        air pollution.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden9">
      <h2>SQL Database</h2>
      <img src="resources/images/schema_conceptuel.jpg">
      <p>After creating an efficient architecture for a fictional social media, we implemented it with PostGreSQL in python.
        This work was made while applying normalization techniques to avoid redundancy and inconsistent dependencies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden10">
      <h2>BI for teleradiology</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/bi_page3_flou.jpg">
      <p>In this project we applied the agile method to meet client's need to optimize the teleradiology staff management. <br/>
        First we used a star schema to represent the architecture of the data. After that we created an ETL 
        (Extract, Transform and Load) process using the EasyFlow software.<br/>
        Finally the data was used in PowerBI to create appealing and insightful interactive dashboards to help decision making.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden11">
      <h2>Video Game Outcome Prediction</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/lol_map1.png" alt="Project 1">
      <p>League of Legends is a very famous yet complex game. 2 teams of 5 players fight each other to destroy the opponent
        "Nexus", the cristal core of a team base. With more than a hundred playable characters and parties averaging 
        30 minutes, one might think that the game outcome is completely unpredictable. However, we managed to accurately determine 
        in advance which team would win based on basic data. <br/>
        We implemented a complete machine learning pipeline with Pyspark (educational purpose, no cluster) for logisitic regression,
        Random Forest and SVM to obtain a final F1 score of more than 0.8, and 0.9 when running a grid-search coupled with 
        cross-validation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden12">
      <h2>Hackathons</h2>
      <img src="resources/images/hackathon.jpg">
      <p>I had the occasion to participate in 2 Hackathons, one organized by Meteo France for the release of their open data.
        The other was organized by Ekimetrics, a consulting firm expert in data driven solutions.
        These intensive challenges were a great opportunity to develop innovative solutions in a short timespan.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden13">
      <h2>Detect AI Generated Text</h2>
      <img src="resources/images/pexels-thepaintedsquare-606541.jpg"
      <p>In a context of exponential growth of AI generated text, it becomes crucial to distinguish them from texts written by humans.
        Thus, we participated in a challenge where the goal was to correctly classify essays in a corpus with several LLMs and students. <br/>
        We used a dataset composed of thousands of essays that was used as input to several architectures. <br/>
        The first one made use of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). It's a simple but powerful
        text method to determine the semantic importance of each word in a document based on its frequency in 
        the given text, relatively to its frequency in the whole corpus. This enabled us to get 
        features for the words that are then fed to a ML classification algorithm, to finally obtain a solid f1 score
        greater than 0,7. <br/>
        The other methods were based on deep neural networks. One was a LSTM, and the other used
        the BERT LLM to make an embedding of the words that would be similarly to TF-IDF given to 
        ML classification algorithm.
