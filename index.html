      <h2>Website Development</h2>
      <p>I wanted to showcase my projects and this portfolio gives me the opportunity to chose how
          to do it. I learnt HTML and CSS basics to create the website from scratch. However,
          I realised that making it responsive was hard, and I wanted to push the visuals a step further.
          This led me to us Chat GPT for specific needs, which I found really useful.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden2">
      <h2>Bird Detection App</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/cygnes.jpg" >
      <p>
        In a group project at IMT Atlantique, we gathered detection and classification algorithms
        with a user-frindely interface to help ornithologists count birds in Lorient harbor. The 
        image recognition system used Tensor-flow and the interface was coded in Java.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden3">
      <h2>Pacman AI</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/pacman.png" >
      <p>During my studies in Madrid, I worked on a project by groups of 2 to develop an Artificial
        Intelligence for Pacman in Python. In a slight modified version of the game, we applied 
        techniques of classification and reinforcement learning to obtain the  best score. We 
        even reached the top 3 of the best autonomous agents in the challenge !
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden4">
      <h2>Antenna Control System</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/antenne.png" >
      <p> With 2 other IMT Atlantique students, we prototyped a system to control an antenna, so that
        it would automatically point towards the direction of a probe balloon. We used electronics, 
        mechanics and control theories.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden5">
      <h2>Autonomous Arduino Car</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/fpa_voiture1.jpg" >
      <p>
        From assembling the robot to calibrating the obstacle detection, we went through all the steps of 
        the development of the miniature self driving car. We could either control it remotely, or let it
        traverse an obstacle course. The Arduino software was coded in C++.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden6">
      <h2>PyRat Challenge</h2>
      <img src="resources/images/pyrat.jpg" >
     <p>This project consisted in developing an artificial intelligence to maximize the score
      of a game developed specifically for this project. In this game, a rat goes through a maze 
      and tries to eat as much cheese as possible within a defined duration. The agent was
      coded in Python thanks to graph theory and consisted in finding rapidly decent solutions of 
      the travelling salesman problem before the game starts.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden7">
      <h2>Offshore windfarms and vessel traffic</h2>
      <img src="./resources/images/ais_heatmap.jpg" alt="Project 1">
      <p>We worked for a company to estimate the influence of offshore wind farms on
        vessel traffic, especially pleasure crafts. The study was possible thanks to Automatic 
        Identification System data gathered since 2016 which was analyzed in parallel with 
        wind farms construction zones.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "hidden" id = "hidden8">
      <h2>Data science project</h2>
      <!-- <img src="" alt="Project 1"> -->
      <p>We are currently choosing the topic. At the moment we plan on establishing
        the influence of climate change on birds diversity and migration.
